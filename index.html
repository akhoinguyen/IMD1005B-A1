                    <h2>Diamonds are glorified Carbon</h2>
                    <p>Diamond is a solid form of the element <span class="bold">Carbon</span> with its atoms arranged
                        in a
                        crystal structure called diamond cubic. This means atomically diamonds are made of the exact
                        same
                        element as graphite and coal, making up your pencil lead. So what makes it so expensive?</p>

                    <h2>History of the diamond trade</h2>
                    <p>Contrary to popular belief, diamonds are not that rare. In fact, other minerals like rubies,
                        emeralds and precious metals like gold and platinum are rarer than diamonds in the Earth's
                        crust. The reason why diamonds are expensive is because of one company: De Beers.</p>
                    <p>During most of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, De Beers had almost monopoly over the diamond mines
                        and markets. With clever marketing campaigns and global supply manipulation tactics, they were
                        able conjure the notion that diamonds are "forever stones" and leave a long-lasting,
                        generational impression that these sparkly rocks represent eternal love.</p>

                        <h2>Synthetic diamonds and the downfall of an empire</h2>
                        <p>With the first successful synthesis of lab diamonds by General Electrics in 1954, lab-grown
                            diamonds have been increasing in popularity. This posed a direct threat to De Beers and
                            prompted the giant to scramble to maintain its grip on the gemstone market.</p>
                        <p>Today, lab diamonds occupy a large portion of the modern jewellery industry and De Beers'
                            market share is a fraction of its past. As more people are educated about the chemistry of
                            this gemstone combined with the unravel of the questionable ethics of the natural diamond
                            mining industry, it is only expected the space lab-created diamonds occupy will only ever
                            increase. </p>
